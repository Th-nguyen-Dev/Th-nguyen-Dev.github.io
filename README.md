This is my first time creating and deploying a JavaScript website, and here is what I have so far! The project makes use of React, Vite, Threejs, React Three Fiber, GSAP, Tailwind, Shadcn, and Redux.

 This README will serve to help you understand how the website works, as well as interesting curiosities I discovered while making this website. I hope you enjoy the read!
